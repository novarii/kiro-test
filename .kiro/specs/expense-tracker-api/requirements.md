# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Personal Expense Tracker REST API is a secure, comprehensive backend system that enables users to manage their personal financial data through a RESTful interface. The system provides JWT-based authentication, multi-account management capabilities, transaction tracking with automatic categorization, and financial analytics including spending summaries and savings rate calculations. This API serves as the foundation for a larger Personal Financial Wellness Platform, focusing on data security, precision in financial calculations, and user-centric design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account and authenticate securely, so that I can access my personal financial data with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid registration details (email, password, name) THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with encrypted password storage
2. WHEN a user attempts to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating the email is already in use
3. WHEN a user provides valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token valid for 24 hours
4. WHEN a user provides invalid login credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error without revealing whether email or password was incorrect
5. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication for protected endpoints
6. WHEN a user accesses any protected endpoint without a valid JWT token THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to manage multiple financial accounts (checking, savings, credit cards), so that I can track all my finances in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new account THEN the system SHALL store account details including name, type, and initial balance
2. WHEN a user requests their account list THEN the system SHALL return only accounts belonging to that user
3. WHEN a user updates account information THEN the system SHALL validate the changes and update only the specified fields
4. WHEN a user attempts to delete an account with existing transactions THEN the system SHALL perform a soft delete to maintain transaction history
5. IF an account type is specified THEN the system SHALL validate it against allowed types (checking, savings, credit, investment)
6. WHEN calculating account balance THEN the system SHALL derive it from the sum of all associated transactions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record and categorize my income and expenses, so that I can understand my spending patterns and financial habits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a transaction THEN the system SHALL require amount, description, date, account ID, and category
2. WHEN a transaction amount is provided THEN the system SHALL store it as a precise decimal value to avoid floating-point errors
3. WHEN a user creates an income transaction THEN the system SHALL record it with a positive amount
4. WHEN a user creates an expense transaction THEN the system SHALL record it with a negative amount
5. WHEN a transaction is created without a category THEN the system SHALL assign a default "Uncategorized" category
6. WHEN a user updates a transaction THEN the system SHALL maintain an audit trail of the change
7. WHEN a user attempts to delete a transaction THEN the system SHALL perform a soft delete to maintain financial history
8. IF a transaction date is not provided THEN the system SHALL default to the current date

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and analyze my spending patterns through monthly summaries and trends, so that I can make informed financial decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests monthly spending summary THEN the system SHALL calculate total income, expenses, and net savings for the specified month
2. WHEN generating spending analysis THEN the system SHALL group expenses by category and calculate percentages
3. WHEN a user requests savings rate calculation THEN the system SHALL compute the percentage of income saved over the specified period
4. WHEN calculating financial metrics THEN the system SHALL use precise decimal arithmetic to ensure accuracy
5. WHEN a user requests trend analysis THEN the system SHALL provide month-over-month comparison data
6. IF no transactions exist for a requested period THEN the system SHALL return zero values with appropriate messaging
7. WHEN generating analytics THEN the system SHALL only include the requesting user's transaction data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my financial data to be secure and properly validated, so that I can trust the system with my sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any financial data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs at the controller level
2. WHEN storing user passwords THEN the system SHALL use strong encryption (bcrypt or equivalent)
3. WHEN a user accesses any endpoint THEN the system SHALL ensure complete data isolation between users
4. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return consistent error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without exposing internal details
6. WHEN processing financial calculations THEN the system SHALL ensure all monetary values are handled with precision
7. IF a user attempts to access another user's data THEN the system SHALL deny access and return a 403 Forbidden response

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with this API, I want consistent RESTful endpoints with proper documentation, so that I can easily build client applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any endpoint THEN the system SHALL follow REST conventions for HTTP methods and status codes
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON structure across all endpoints
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses with timestamp, status, and message
4. WHEN the API is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide OpenAPI 3 documentation accessible via Swagger UI
5. WHEN endpoints require authentication THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this in the API documentation
6. IF rate limiting is implemented THEN the system SHALL return appropriate headers indicating limits and remaining requests
7. WHEN API versioning is needed THEN the system SHALL use URL path versioning (e.g., /api/v1/)
